                      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                      The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                      the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.‚Äù

                    ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                    100% recommend! ‚Äù
